# Vite + React + Google ADK (MCP)

This starter demonstrates a Vite + React app configured to work with MCP-style integrations.

Quick start

1. cd projects/vite-adk-mcp
2. npm install
3. copy `.env.example` -> `.env` and configure your MCP server info
4. npm run dev

Notes
- MCP commonly requires server-side components; review `reference/gemini-fullstack` and `movie-app-react-adk` for production patterns.
